After conquering the city of Meereen, Daenerys decides to change the language of the city to Dothraki language. 
The people of Meereen do not know this language, but they try to learn. 
However, since this language is all new to these people, they prone to making mistakes while using the vocabulary of the Dothraki language. 
Daenerys notices this problem and wants you to design a program that will help people on usage of vocabulary. 
This program will check whether a word is in vocabulary and if it is not, it will give some suggestions based on the searched word.
